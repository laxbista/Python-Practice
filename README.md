This excercise contains Python questions from https://pynative.com/python-exercises-with-solutions/ and solution of my own.
I choose this excercise to practice on my python and git/github skills. This is my first time using github repository.
This repo is for my learning purpose. I highly appreciate those who would give feedback on my code. Also i encourage others, who are new to python and want to learn by doing excercise to try this repo.
